 the commands:

Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/Face_recognition
Create and Activate Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv face_recognition_env
source face_recognition_env/bin/activate
Check Installed Packages:

bash
Copy code
pip list
Ensure that pip and setuptools are installed with the required versions.

Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Face Recognition System:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will initiate the face recognition system, performing face filtering, encoding, and predictions.

Capture Your Own Faces:

Create a folder with your name.
Inside the folder, create separate directories for training and testing datasets.
Run the following command to capture your faces:
bash
Copy code
python capture.py
Use 'c' to capture pictures using the camera and 'q' to quit the capture loop.
Add the captured images to the training dataset and include a few in the testing dataset.
Train and Test the Face Recognition System:

Run python main.py again to train the model with the updated datasets.
The system will predict faces based on the trained model.
By following these steps, you'll create and activate a virtual environment, install required dependencies, and run the face recognition system. Additionally, the system allows you to capture and add your own faces for personalized recognition.
